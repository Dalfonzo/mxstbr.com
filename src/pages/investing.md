I irregularly angel invest small checks ($2500-$5000) of my own money in early-stage startups I'm excited about. Think of me as an advisor with skin in the game — I love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to my network and audience, or even just lending an ear to founders building exciting new things.

### What I invest in

I invest if I think I can provide value to you, whether through advice, audience, network, credibility or anything else. If I can't help you at all, it probably doesn't make sense for you to take my money.

I love investing in products that I (would) use myself, even more so if they're products aimed at developers.

I love investing early to make the most of the limited amount of money I have. The earlier, the better.

### Investments

So far, I have invested in:

- _Unannounced developer startup_
- _Unannounced developer startup #2_
- [Lambda Store](https://lambda.store), the serverless database for Redis
- [DevJobs.at](https://devjobs.at), a job matching service for developers in Austria
- [Mikafi](https://mikafi.com), a consumer coffee roaster
