My ultimate goal in life is to found a billion dollar startup.

### Why

Prestige and wealth are of course a part of that, but even more so it's about the challenge and impact. I [love inventing](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1329718366769205248) [things that](https://reactboilerplate.com) [a lot](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) [of people](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) [use](https://github.com/styled-components/polished).

The underlying, abstract goal is that I want my life to matter. I am incredibly lucky to be in the tech industry where my actions can influence millions of people. I want to use that unique opportunity I've been given the best I can.

Hence why I want to “found a billion dollar startup”.<sup>[^1]</sup>

### How

Billion dollar startups require an novel idea that solves a previously unknown need in a large market. However, I am terrible at having these ideas. My [first startup](https://spectrum.chat) failed because we didn't manage to find a viable business model before we [ran out of money](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1068553322196606977).

My best shot is working with people who are really good at this. To convince them to work on their idea with me (rather than anyone else) I need to be the best technical co-founder possible.

**Step goal: be a better technical co-founder.**

The followup question then is: are there order of magnitude improvements I could make as a technical co-founder?

I am an engineer and already have the skills necessary to build a MVP for anything [in a weekend](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1282573327576567808) and simultaneously [architect apps for scale](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum). I could definitely keep working on my coding skills, but at this point becoming a 10x better engineer is going to take a while.

However, there are lower hanging fruit. If the goal is to build a billion dollar startup, we'll have to have immense growth. To sustain that we need to hire as many good people as we can and put them to effective use.

I have never managed a group of engineers before or seen a really well-functioning large engineering organisation. If I already knew how to do this, that would be a big bonus and definitely 10x my chances as a technical co-founder.

**Step goal: learn engineering management.**

I think the quickest way to learn how to be a really good engineering manager is to go work at a company that is renowned for their really good engineering culture as a manager. It needs to be big enough to have infrastructure around training and helping managers (say, more than 500 people?) but small enough to where there's still room to grow (say, less than 5000 people?).

I also want to move to SF, at least for some time, as that's (still) the epicentre for startups, so ideally we're talking about a company that has an office in/around SF and enough lawyers in-house to make immigration a non-issue.

So, that's what I'm going to do next.
