ðŸ‘‹ I am Max, the technical co-founder of [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat). Spectrum is an [open source](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) chat app for large online communities and was recently acquired by GitHub. We are a team of three with a predominantly frontend and design background and have worked on it for close to two years.

### Regret 1: We Did Not Focus On Our Niche

- Wanted to build for our use case, open knowledge communities (e.g. open source)
- Needed to make money, so built business features
- Businesses were not interested, and had we focused on our core niche use case we would have grown much faster
- Easier to raise money if necessary, more satisfying, ultimately more momentum and higher chance at success

- Better to have 100 true fans who love the product than 10,000 barely interested users

### Regret 2: We Did Not Do Enough Marketing

- Spend too much time on building new, shiny features
- Should have spent more time on marketing, typical engineering mistake
- Not just social media, but also in-product growth marketing, marketing pages on the website, etc.

- Do more marketing and sales than you want to do

### Regret 2.3: We Did Not Tell Our Story

- Branding was good and unique
- Brand did not have minimum viable personality https://avc.com/2011/09/minimum-viable-personality/
- The Practical Dev (dev.to) is doing a great job at this

- Tell your story, it sets you apart from the big guys

### Regret 2.6: We Did Not Launch Often Enough

- Launches are great for marketing, every new release excites customers
- Shipped tons of stuff without ever announcing it
- Missed opportunity to showcase a new feature and get more users at the same time

- Launch early, launch often

### Regret 3: We Did Not Iterate (Quickly) Enough

- Had an early MVP built with minimal technology (Firebase)
- Saw some tiny traction, thought we needed proper setup for custom functionality

- Should have stuck with MVP setup and iterated until we felt higher traction, the custom functionality did not make the difference

### Regret 4: We Did Not Talk Enough With Users

- Went into a hole and built a shiny feature for months (e.g. WYSIWYG editing) without talking to users about their priorities
- Ended up wasting valuable time and adding a lot of unnessary tech debt

- Should have spent more time talking with our users
- Should have opened up our roadmap and let users tell us what their priorities are
