ðŸ‘‹ I am Max, the technical co-founder of [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat). Spectrum is an [open source](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) chat app for large online communities and was recently acquired by GitHub. We are a team of three with a predominantly frontend and design background and have worked on it for close to two years.

### Mistake 1: We Did Not Tell Our Story

- Branding was good and unique, but we did not do enough marketing
- Brand did not have minimum viable personality https://avc.com/2011/09/minimum-viable-personality/ 
- Should have told our story

### Mistake 2: We Thought We Would Be Quicker

- Thought we could build another product "after" Spectrum
- Named company Space Program Inc.
- Never done with one product, never mind starting another one

### Mistake 3: We Did Not Focus On Our Niche

- Wanted to build for our use case, open knowledge communities (e.g. open source)
- Needed to make money, so built business features for a broader audience of businesses generally
- Businesses were not interested, and had we focused on our core niche use case we would have grown much faster (like we are right now)

### Mistake 4: We Did Not Do Enough Marketing

- Spend too much time on development and crafting the perfect experience
- Should have spent more time on marketing, typical engineering mistake
- Not just social media, but also in-product growth marketing, marketing pages on the website, etc.

### Mistake 5: We Did Not Iterate (Quickly) Enough

- Had an early MVP built with minimal technology
- Saw some tiny traction, though we needed to have proper setup to be able to do custom things
- Should have stuck with MVP setup and iterated and experimented like mad until we felt much higher traction (you know when you have product-market fit, we did not)
