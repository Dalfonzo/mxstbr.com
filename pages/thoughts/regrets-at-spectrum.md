ðŸ‘‹ I am Max, the technical co-founder of [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat). Spectrum is an [open source](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) chat app for large online communities and was recently acquired by GitHub. We are a team of three with a predominantly frontend and design background and have worked on it for close to two years.

### Regret 1: We Did Not Focus On Our Niche

- Wanted to build for our use case, open knowledge communities (e.g. open source)
- Needed to make money, so built business features for a broader audience of businesses generally
- Businesses were not interested, and had we focused on our core niche use case we would have grown much faster (like we are right now)
- Better to have 1,000 true fans than 100,000 users who are barely interested

### Regret 2: We Did Not Do Enough Marketing

- Spend too much time on development and crafting the perfect experience
- Should have spent more time on marketing, typical engineering mistake
- Not just social media, but also in-product growth marketing, marketing pages on the website, etc.

### Regret 2.5: We Should Have Told Our Story

- Branding was good and unique
- Brand did not have minimum viable personality https://avc.com/2011/09/minimum-viable-personality/
- The Practical Dev (dev.to) is doing a great job at this

### Regret 3: We Did Not Iterate (Quickly) Enough

- Had an early MVP built with minimal technology
- Saw some tiny traction, though we needed to have proper setup to be able to do custom things
- Should have stuck with MVP setup and iterated and experimented like mad until we felt much higher traction (you know when you have product-market fit, we did notâ€”only concept-market fit)
